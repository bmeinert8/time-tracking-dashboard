## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:
  - Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats.
  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
  - Stat data should be fetched from data file.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup for structure.
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with variables, flexbox, CSS grid, and media queries for responsive design.
- **JavaScript** - Data fetching, dynamic stat rendering, and navigation.
- **Rubik Font** - Imported via Google Fonts for typography.
- **Frontend Mentor Assets** - Images and design files provided by the challenge.

### What I learned
This project provided a great opportunity to learn how to fetch and display data from data files using the Fetch API. Based on a selected timeframe in the navigation options, stats would be dynamilcally rendered to the different stat cards with matching data titles.

### Continued Development
In the future, I'd like to look into adding some more in depth data options that would become viewable upon expanding a selected card via the ellipsis icon. I would also like to rebuild this feature in the future using a framework when learning.
